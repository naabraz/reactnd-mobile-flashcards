# Mobile Flashcards

This is a study project for the Udacity React Nanodegree Program.

Here I'm using React Native to build a Mobile Flashcards that allows you to add decks for a specific subject and fill this decks with cards.

For each card there is a Correct or Incorrect response. After the last question answered, the score is shown and saved.

If you respond the same quiz at the same day, the score is replaced with the newest.

The app send push notifications every day to remind you to start a quiz.
